# SRCCON Talks Watch Parties 🎉
_We’re replaying five talks from SRCCON 2020 for the public. Join us!_

This year, we brought “Talks” to our annual SRCCON programming, and it was a huge success! If the majority of SRCCON is dedicated to sessions, where attendees get in the weeds and do the work of changing journalism, the six talks we brought to SRCCON were meant to give them a shared foundation upon which to do that work. 

Our talks were only available for SRCCON 2020 attendees, until now.

We’re happy to announce that we’ll be replaying five of our talks from SRCCON 2020, both because they feature important conversations that deserve ongoing discussion and attention, and because we heard from so many SRCCON attendees this year that they’d love to share some of our 2020 talks with peers, their team, or their organization!

<strong>📣 Our Watch Parties series has concluded!</strong> 🙏 Thank you to the hundreds of folks who signed up. <a href="https://opennews.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=71c95e9a43708843d2fdc1f09&id=996e9290cc">Join the OpenNews community mailing list</a> to hear about future events like this one.

<!-- Here’s how it’ll work (or <a href="#sign-up">jump straight to signing up</a>). -->

### Schedule

## 📽 Public Watch Party Schedule

Once a week for five weeks, we’ll host a free watch party, featuring one of our talks from SRCCON 2020. During the watch party, we’ll do a brief intro, replay the video of the talk, and then host a live Q&A with our speakers, who have generously agreed to come! We’re also calling these parties because we’re anticipating that groups of people will be coming together to meet one another, and engage together with these talks and ideas! 

**Please note:** Watch parties will only be available live and will NOT be recorded. Can't make it or interested in setting up a re-watch with your team or org? <a href="#do-it-yourself">You've got options.</a> 

Here's the schedule:

* **<span class="week-name">Week 1:</span> Alicia Bell and Tauhid Chappell** on campaigning and organizing as journalists and inside our own organizations. Alicia and Tauhid will be there for live Q&A.
<ul class="action-links">

</ul>
* **<span class="week-name">Week 2:</span> Moiz Syed and Ellis Simani** on objectivity, privilege, and how we report on protests. Reflecting on another year of Black Lives Matter protests and the coverage that ensued, this talk explores the history of our industry, the ideals it upholds, and the deep fault lines running through our newsrooms as they fail to accurately represent the diversity of our people. Moiz and Ellis will be there for live Q&A.

### Do it yourself

## Setup A Watch Party For Your Team
If you can’t make it to one of our public watch parties, but would love to watch one of the SRCCON 2020 talks as a team, group, or organization, you’ve got options!

  * **Publicly available talks:** Some of our talks will be made completely available to the public after we host our watch party. In these cases, you can organize a watch party with the link directly! We’ll also post links to a “study guide” with both potential discussion prompts, as well as suggested readings to learn more about topics covered in the talk.
  * **Talks available for private watch parties only:** To respect our speaker’s wishes, some of our talks are only available to be shared  as a temporary link, along with a study guide! If you’re interested in hosting a private watch party for your group, [let us know](mailto:srccon@opennews.org) which talk you’re interested in, and we can talk about the options available for that talk.

If you’d like to host something a little more official and you’d like the speakers to attend for discussion or Q&A, let us know and we can ask the speakers on your behalf. In these cases, we’d ask that you pay the speakers for their time.

Interested in the full list of talks at SRCCON 2020 this year? [See the complete list here](https://2020.srccon.org/attendee-faq/#talks-at-srccon-how-do-they-work). If you’re a SRCCON 2020 attendee, full talk transcripts are available in the SRCCON attendee resource guide you used during the conference. If you need a link, [email us](mailto:srccon@opennews.org) and we can send it over!
