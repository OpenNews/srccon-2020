# SRCCON Talks Watch Parties üéâ
_We‚Äôre replaying five talks from SRCCON 2020 for the public. Join us!_

This year, we brought ‚ÄúTalks‚Äù to our annual SRCCON programming, and it was a huge success! If the majority of SRCCON is dedicated to sessions, where attendees get in the weeds and do the work of changing journalism, the six talks we brought to SRCCON were meant to give them a shared foundation upon which to do that work. 

Our talks were only available for SRCCON 2020 attendees, until now.

We‚Äôre happy to announce that we‚Äôll be replaying five of our talks from SRCCON 2020, both because they feature important conversations that deserve ongoing discussion and attention, and because we heard from so many SRCCON attendees this year that they‚Äôd love to share some of our 2020 talks with peers, their team, or their organization!

Here‚Äôs how it‚Äôll work:

### Schedule

## üìΩ Public Watch Party Schedule

Once a week for five weeks, we‚Äôll host a free watch party, featuring one of our talks from SRCCON 2020. During the watch party, we‚Äôll do a brief intro, replay the video of the talk, and then host a live Q&A with our speakers, who have generously agreed to come! We‚Äôre also calling these parties because we‚Äôre anticipating that groups of people will be coming together to meet one another, and engage together with these talks and ideas!

  * **Thursday, August 20: Alicia Bell and Tauhid Chappell** on campaigning and organizing as journalists and inside our own organizations. Live Q&A with Alicia and Tauhid to follow. Presented with the [Free Press](https://www.freepress.net/). [Sign-up here](TK).


Sign-up links COMING SOON:

  * **Thursday, September 3: John Hernandez** on burning it all down, and the problematic, inherited cultures imbued within journalism. Live Q&A with John to follow. 
  * **Thursday, September 10: Doris Truong and Samantha Ragland** on how no matter where you are on your organization‚Äôs ladder, you have agency and power. Live Q&A with Doris and Samantha to follow. Presented with Poynter. This talk will be made fully public after the watch party.
  * **Thursday, September 17: Tasneem Raja in conversation with Candice Fortman**, on the joys and challenges of being a woman of color leading her own newsroom, while working within an ecosystem of racist policies and institutions. Live Q&A with Tasneem and Candice to follow.
  * **More to be announced!** Want to partner and co-host one of the talks?

### Do it yourself

## Set up a Watch Party for your team
If you can‚Äôt make it to one of our public watch parties, but would love to watch one of the SRCCON 2020 talks as a team, group, or organization, you‚Äôve got options!

  * **Publicly available talks:** Some of our talks will be made completely available to the public after we host our watch party. In these cases, you can organize a watch party with the link directly! We‚Äôll also post links to a ‚Äústudy guide‚Äù with both potential discussion prompts, as well as suggested readings to learn more about topics covered in the talk.
  * **Talks available for private watch parties only:** To respect our speaker‚Äôs wishes, some of our talks are only available to be shared  as a temporary link, along with a study guide! If you‚Äôre interested in hosting a private watch party for your group, let us know which talk you‚Äôre interested in, and we can talk about the options available for that talk.


If you‚Äôd like to host something a little more official and you‚Äôd like the speakers to attend for discussion or Q&A, let us know and we can ask the speakers on your behalf. In these cases, we‚Äôd ask that you pay the speakers for their time.

If you‚Äôre a SRCCON 2020 attendee, full talk transcripts are available in the SRCCON attendee resource guide you used during the conference. If you need a link, email us and we can send it over!
