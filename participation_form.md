We can't wait to hear how you'd like to be part of SRCCON 2020! You can read [more about the many ways to participate](/attendees), and please feel free to reach out to us at [srccon@opennews.org](mailto:srccon@opennews.org) with any questions.

Our [session proposal guide](/sessions/proposal-guide/) answers a lot of questions about bringing your ideas to the SRCCON 2020 program. If you're all set, the participation form is below!
