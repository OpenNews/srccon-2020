# Volunteer at SRCCON 2020

We need YOU to help make SRCCON work. In addition to participants leading sessions throughout our conferences, we also need a small group of people to help us keep things running smoothly. Want to help? Consider volunteering.

This year, volunteering is going to take shape in a way that it hasn't before, as we shift to a virtual format. We need volunteers throughout the event and are especially interested in support from folks:

* across various time zones
* with comfort on different technical platforms
* with flexibility and a willingness to learn as we go

We'll need a few different kinds of help from volunteers this year. If you're interested in volunteering for the entire event, we're able to offer a free ticket. We also would love help for smaller amounts of time, too. In both cases, you'll have our gratitude and the knowledge that you played an integral role in making SRCCON a success.

If you want to attend a SRCCON event and are excited about playing this type of vital support role, [please email us for information](mailto:srccon.org) about volunteering or simply mark that you'd like to help in the [call for participation form](/participation/form).
