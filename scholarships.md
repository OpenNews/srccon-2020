# Scholarships for SRCCON 2020

Whether you're a newsroom developer at a small organization with a strained professional development budget or a freelance developer eager to learn more about journalism code and tech, we want to help you attend SRCCON events.

We're approaching scholarships a little differently for SRCCON 2020: We're offering a free ticket for folks who need it and a stipend to support the participation of anyone who would not otherwise be compensated for their time during the conference.

There's no separate application. The scholarship ticket will be one of the options on the ticket purchase page, and scholarship questions for the stipend are part of our [call for participation form](/participation/form).

### About the scholarship process

## What we're offering

* A free ticket to attend the event, and/or
* A $250 stipend to compensate for participation in the event

## Who should apply
 
The tickets are for:
* Anyone in the journalism-tech community who is unable to purchase a ticket to attend, in particular laid-off, unemployed, and freelance journalists
* Tickets are prioritized for Black, indigneous, and people of color journalists

The stipends are for:

* Anyone eligible for a ticket, whose time to participate is otherwise not compensated, such as because of unemployment or needing to take time off to participate 

## How to apply

Questions to apply for the stipend are included in the call for participation form. The scholarship ticket will be available through the registration process, no separate application necessary. 

## When notifications go out

The stipend notifications will go out on July 1.

## What happens after the event

You tell us how it went! We'll send you a short followup survey and will be excited to check out anything you write or build coming out of your participation.

## Why do you offer these scholarships?

We want to make sure that SRCCON events include the diversity of the communities we serveâ€”geographically, demographically, experientially, and more. In the past, we've offered this scholarship because we know that travel costs can be a hardship, and offered this scholarship as a way to help mitigate that. We've adapted the scholarship this year in response to the acute financial situation facing many journalists in 2020.

## How do you decide who will receive a scholarship?

OpenNews staff reviews all applications. We prioritize applications from members of communities underrepresented in journalism and technology and from smaller and non-coastal newsrooms.

## When will I receive my stipend?

When we notify stipend recipients, we'll include information about how to receive the stipend funds. In short, you will need to fill out a form and send some tax paperwork for our administrators to process the payment. It may take a month or so for check processing.
