### When & where

SRCCON 2020 is July 15-17, online!

### How to be a part of SRCCON 2020

**[Our call for participation form is open!](/participation/form)** The priority deadline for session proposals is Wednesday, June 24.

This year will be our first digital SRCCON, and we're building an online space based on what we collectively value about the physical experience. There are lots of ways to participate in SRCCON 2020—you could:

* [facilitate a session](/sessions/proposal-guide/)
* help us prepare for the event
* share your questions and experiences as an attendee
* lead a conversation about something you're passionate about (including your hobbies outside of work)

Or suggest something we haven't thought of yet. The [participation form](/participation/form) will help you tell us how you'd like to be part of SRCCON 2020, and our [session proposal guide](/sessions/proposal-guide/) can help you shape ideas for the program. We'll review entries on a rolling basis, and if invited to attend or facilitate a session, you'll have the chance to [purchase a ticket](/attendees/#tickets). The program will take place over the course of three days, with a mix of asynchronous and timed sessions, largely between the hours of 9am-9pm ET to accommodate participation from as many time zones as possible.

Key dates for your calendar:

* **Wednesday, June 24:** Priority deadline for session proposals
* **Thursday, June 25:** We'll start reviewing and selecting session proposals. We'll continue to review proposals as we have space in the program, specifically looking for sessions that react to events as they happen.
* **By Wednesday, July 1:** We'll begin sending out session notifications

### About SRCCON 2020

SRCCON 2020 will be fully online and in the midst of both a global crisis and reckoning within journalism. We expect that in some ways, it will be unlike any event we’ve held before. What we do know, however, is that SRCCON 2020 will remain a unique, accessible, and inclusive event that hosts frank, challenging, nurturing, and creative conversations that need to be had.

At SRCCON, you'll:

* be part of hands-on workshops that reimagine newsroom tech, teamwork, leadership, community, and journalism itself —not panels where you sit back and listen, but sessions where you participate and learn.
* connect with people who share your hopes and dreams for journalism—not just making professional acquaintances, but creating personal relationships that last.
* bring who you are into a conference that thinks about the program, the schedule—even games & meals—as ways to celebrate everything you have to share.

SRCCON programs are built by participants, and previous attendees have already expressed interest this year in talking about topics like: leading during crisis, nurturing staff remotely, navigating uncertain career paths, reshaping team workflows, and organizing collective action to address the systemic racism in our industry. We can't wait to hear what _you_ want to talk about.

SRCCON will be a place to re-energize, personally and professionally, and the care participants take with one another animates every piece of our shared program. The conversations that happen here come from the community and reflect its values:

* **We lead change**—by challenging the power structures that have failed our industry, we push for long-lasting change in our organizations, led by journalists of color and journalists in local and regional newsrooms.
* **We support one another**—by offering each other our expertise and empathy, we find new collaborators, help each other learn, and make our networks and organizations more resilient.
* **We experiment in the open**—by sharing our work and processes, we do the transformative work our organizations need to better connect with and inform our communities.

Our work exists to create a future where journalists can work in newsrooms that are equitable, inclusive, and collaborative. We hold space for you to bring your entire self to SRCCON, just as we hope that one day everyone will be able to bring their whole selves to work—instead of feeling the need to self-oppress because of identity or background. We also hope to provide the community, environment, and support you need to focus on your work (or what you're passionate about), and at least for a while, do it without carrying extra weight.

### Who attends SRCCON events

Our participants represent organizations ranging from massive to tiny, and come from all over the U.S. and many other countries. Accessibility is a core value, and we always offer [live session transcripts and tons of documentation](https://2019.srccon.org/documentation/) for those who can't attend in person. This year, we're excited to expand possibilities for attendees even further. Much of the SRCCON program will be available across multiple time zones and through asynchronous participation—if you need to take care of the popsicle your kid just dropped on the floor or step away for an urgent call, we want to make it possible to participate around the complexity of this moment.

SRCCON participants are developers, designers, journalists, editors, and allies: the practitioners and leaders who are transforming their newsrooms into more representative and innovative places to work. Participants come to SRCCON to change journalism by creating more intentional processes, better relationships with the communities they cover, and new ways to engage and inform people.

### How much does it cost?

[Ticket prices start at $125](/attendees/#tickets), plus ticketing fees. We'll also offer a limited number of need-based, [free scholarship tickets as well as $250 stipends](/scholarships) for attendees whose time to attend would otherwise be uncompensated.

SRCCON events don't have open sale dates or lotteries. If you want to come to SRCCON 2020, our [call for participation](/participation/form) is how to let us know.
