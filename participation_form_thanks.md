# Thank you for answering our call for participation!

Thanks for your interest in attending SRCCON. If you applied to attend, we'll get back to you within a few business days, and if invited, you will have the chance to [purchase a ticket](/attendees/#tickets) starting at $125 plus fees. If you proposed an idea for the program, we'll read it through and get in touch by July 1! And if you asked about stipends or let us know about some other way you'd like to participate at SRCCON 2020, we'll follow up with you on those things by July 1, too.

Do you have a colleague who you'd like to see join us July 15-17? Please ask them to apply! Personal recommendations are the best way to bring more people into this community, and your help reaching beyond our own networks is a key part of making sure SRCCON events are inclusive and representative.

Some key details to share:

* We'll begin sending out session and scholarship notifications by **Wednesday, July 1**
* Attendees will hear from us on a rolling basis within a few days of filling out our call for participation form.

**Reminder to session proposers:** Because SRCCON is a collaborative, peer-to-peer event, we ask that all participants buy a ticket. Our [ticketing process includes scholarships, stipends, and other options](/attendees/#tickets) to make the event accessible to everyone.

And you can also send any additional session proposals to us at [srccon@opennews.org](mailto:srccon@opennews.org)—no need to fill out the form a second time.
