# Projects, Products, & Research

This track is here to connect you with tools and ideas you can use in your newsroom _right now_. We've invited the folks behind some amazing journalism projects to share intro videos and demos in advance, and they'll be available throughout SRCCON 2020 to meet up for 1-1 and group conversations.

Projects cover everything from technical tools for journalism to frameworks for reimagining newsroom workflows. There are channels for each one in the SRCCON Slack, so meet them below, then connect with them there!

The Accountability Project curates, standardizes and indexes public data to give journalists, researchers and others a simple way to search across otherwise siloed records—676.8 million of them so far.

Big Local News cleans and shares data so that journalists and researchers can discover and write stories about policies that affect their communities. The Big Local platform helps journalists collaborate on projects and use data in local stories. Tools like the COVID-19 Case Mapper make it easier for local newsrooms to investigate data and share it with their readers.

Datasette is a tool for exploring and publishing data. It helps people take data of any shape or size and publish that as an interactive, explorable website and accompanying API. Datasette is aimed at data journalists, museum curators, archivists, local governments, and anyone else who has data that they wish to share with the world.

“The Quilt: Policy, Art, and Healing” is a joint effort by Voices for Racial Justice and The UpTake that aims to transform the ways in which Minnesota’s BIPOC communities approach both legislative policy work and legislative reporting. The magazine used the Journalism of Color methodology to create the reporting and applied a racial equity impact analysis to legislative storytelling.
